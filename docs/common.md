The framework focuses on attributes of specific malware families, but many are human operated and therefore a variety of methods could be used to gain access or escalate privileges. This page lists some of the common methods that are being used.

WARNING: This list is not extensive. An attacker could use any method to gain initial access, but you should be looking for the below items as part of your investigation since they are so common. 

This page is a work in progress.

# Common Initial Access Methods

- Phishing [^2]
- Exploiting Public facing applications [^2]
- VPN/RDP access [^2]
- Trusted relationships [^2]
- Initial Access Brokers [^3]


# Common Downloader Methods

- Buer Loader [^1]
- BazaLoader [^1]
- TrickBot [^1]
- ZLoader [^1]
- IcedID [^1]


# Common Human Operated C2 Methods
- Installing Cobalt Strike Beacons
- Using Remote Desktop and stolen credentials
- Installing other remote access software, such as AnyDesk

# Common Discovery Methods

- Active Directory Discovery
  - ADfind
  - Bloodhound 
- Powertools to collects information about users, networks, and systems in the network
- Network Scanning to identify targets and shared resources
  - Angry Scanner 
  - Advanced Port Scanner 

# Common Exfiltration Methods
- Using rclone or scp
- Sending data to common file sharing domains (SendSpace, MEGA, etc)
- Sending data to their private servers

# Common Propagation Methods
- Copy EXE to shared folder and execute via PsExec
- Copy EXE to each computer and launch via RDP
- Copy EXE to each computer via remote access tools and execute it manually
  - Splashtop
  - Atera
  - LogMeIn
  - TeamViewer
- Update Group Policy Object on Domain Controller to download and create scheduled task

# Common Files To Be Encrypted
Each malware family has its own set of rules to identify files to encrypt. The details are usually not important for DFIR, which is why this is not a category in the framework. But, some examples are included here for those who have not seen them before. Many focus on what files to NOT encrypt in order to make the machine still usable and able to pay the ransom.
